        <h2>What is a Program?</h2>
        <p>Think of a program as a detailed recipe for the computer. Just as a chef follows a list of steps to turn raw ingredients into a meal, a computer follows a program to turn raw data into something useful, like a video game or a text document. At its heart, a program is simply a long list of instructions stored in the computer's memory. Since computers aren't actually "smart", they are just incredibly fast at following orders. A program must break down complex tasks into tiny, simple steps, such as "add these two numbers" or "move this value to a different spot."</p>

        <h2>How it looks to the computer</h2>
        <p>To make this easier for beginners to visualize, a program travels through different "languages" before the hardware can actually run it:</p>
        
        <div class="list-container">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High-Level Language:</strong> The way humans write (like Java or Python). It uses words like if, while, and print.</li>
                <li><strong>Assembly Language:</strong> The middle ground (what this website teaches). It translates those human concepts into direct commands for the CPU, like ADD or LOAD.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Code:</strong> The final destination. This is just a stream of 1s and 0s (binary) that tells the electrical circuits inside the processor exactly what to do.</li>
            </ul>

      <h2>Introduction to Binary</h2>
      <p>Humans count in Base-10 (Decimal), likely because we have ten fingers. We use ten symbols ('0' through '9') to build every number imaginable. But a computer doesn't have fingers; it has transistors. A transistor is essentially a microscopic light switch. It can only be in one of two states: ON or OFF. Because of this physical reality, computers use Binary (Base-2).</p>
      <h3>The Power of 2</h3>
      <p>In binary we only have two symbols: 0 and 1.
         <li>
            <ul>0 represents "Off" (Low voltage)</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>1 represents "On" (High voltage)</ul>
        </li>

        <h3>Bits and Bytes</h3>
        <p>To keep things organized, we give these switches names based on how we group them:</p>
        <li>
            <ul>Bit: A single "Binary Digit" (0 or 1). This is the smallest unit of data.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>Byte: A group of 8 bits. A single byte can represent 2^8 (256) different values, which is enough to cover every character on a standard keyboard.</ul>
        </li>
        <div class = "image-row">
        <img src = "Bits_bytes.png" class = "Bits_bytes" alt = "Bits_bytes">

        </div>

        <h2>Logic gates</h2>
        <p>If Binary is the "alphabet" of a computer, Logic Gates are the "verbs." They are the physical components that actually do something with those 0s and 1s.On your website, you can frame Logic Gates as the bridge between raw electricity and actual thinking.What is a Logic Gate?A logic gate is a tiny electronic component (made of transistors) that takes one or two binary inputs and spits out a single output based on a specific rule.</p>
        <h3>The AND Gate</h3>
        <p>The AND gate only outputs a 1 if both inputs are 1.</p>
        <li>
            <ul>Rule: "I will only turn on if Input A AND Input B are both ON.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>Real-life example: A safety system where two different buttons must be pressed at the same time to start a machine.</ul>
        </li> 

        <h3>The OR Gate</h3>
        <p>The OR gate outputs a 1 if at least one input is 1.</p>
        <li>
            <ul>Rule: "I will turn on if Input A OR Input B (or both) are ON.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>Real-life example: A doorbell system where either the front door button or the back door button triggers the same bell.</ul>
        </li> 

        <h3>The NOT Gate</h3>
        <p>The NOT gate is a "rebel." It only has one input and it flips it to the opposite.</p>
        <li>
            <ul>Rule: "If you give me a 1, I'll give you a 0. If you give me a 0, I'll give you a 1.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>Real-life example: A "low fuel" light that turns ON only when the fuel sensor signal goes OFF.</ul>
        </li>
