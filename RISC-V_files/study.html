        <h2>What is a Program?</h2>
        <p>Think of a program as a detailed recipe for the computer. Just as a chef follows a list of steps to turn raw ingredients into a meal, a computer follows a program to turn raw data into something useful, like a video game or a text document. At its heart, a program is simply a long list of instructions stored in the computer's memory. Since computers aren't actually "smart"—they are just incredibly fast at following orders. A program must break down complex tasks into tiny, simple steps, such as "add these two numbers" or "move this value to a different spot."</p>

        <h2>How it looks to the computer</h2>
        <p>To make this easier for beginners to visualize, a program travels through different "languages" before the hardware can actually run it:</p>
        
        <div class="list-container">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High-Level Language:</strong> The way humans write (like Java or Python). It uses words like if, while, and print.</li>
                <li><strong>Assembly Language:</strong> The middle ground (what this website teaches). It translates those human concepts into direct commands for the CPU, like ADD or LOAD.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Code:</strong> The final destination. This is just a stream of 1s and 0s (binary) that tells the electrical circuits inside the processor exactly what to do.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

      <h2>What is a CPU?</h2>
    <p>The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the main part of a computer that does the thinking and decision-making. It processes instructions, performs calculations, and controls how other parts of the computer work. Because of this, the CPU is often called the brain of the computer.
       Every time you open an app, type on a keyboard, or browse a website, the CPU is working behind the scenes to make it happen.</p>
