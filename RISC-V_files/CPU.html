        <div class="info-box1">
            RISC-V (pronounced “risk-five”) is an open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC). It was developed in 2010 at the University of California, Berkeley.

            Key features:
            <ul>
                <li>Simplicity: Small, fixed instruction formats make hardware implementation easier.</li>
                <li>Modularity: Base ISA with optional extensions.</li>
                <li>Open-source: Anyone can implement RISC-V without royalties.</li>
                <li>Scalability: Works from microcontrollers to supercomputers.</li>

        <h3 class="title2">AI and the Vector Revolution</h3>
        <div class="info-box2">
           The AI boom requires hardware that can process massive amounts of data simultaneously. RISC-V is becoming the industry favorite for AI accelerators because of its Vector Extension (RVV). This allows engineers to create custom instructions tailored specifically for neural networks, enabling more efficient machine learning directly on the device, from smart cameras to data center racks.

    <h3 class="title3">Security Through Transparency</h3>
    <div class="info-box3">Proprietary chips often act as "black boxes," where security flaws or backdoors can remain hidden for years. Because the RISC-V ISA is open and transparent, it undergoes constant global peer review. This "security through transparency" model allows developers to verify every line of hardware logic, making it the top choice for high-security applications like banking, government, and encrypted communications.</div>

    <h3 class="title4">A Growing Software Ecosystem</h3>
    <div class="info-box4">A processor is only as good as the software that runs on it. The RISC-V ecosystem has matured rapidly, with official support now available for Android, Linux, and FreeBSD. With the backing of the RISE (RISC-V Software Ecosystem) consortium—which includes members like Google, Intel, and Nvidia—the gap between RISC-V and established giants like ARM is closing faster than ever.</div>
